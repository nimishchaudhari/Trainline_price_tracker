# Trainline Price Tracker

This Price Finder shows the possible transits based on the entered dates.
It uses trainline [API Wrapper]{https://github.com/tducret/trainline-python} to find the data.

### Example
```bash
python thecode.py Toulouse Quillan "22/07/2020 06:00" "24/07/2020 06:00"
```
In case of having insufficient inputs, it returns an itinerary of Bruxelles to Paris.

### Requirements
```
trainline (available on pip)
```
